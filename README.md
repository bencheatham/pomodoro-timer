# Pomodoro Timer with Todos


# Overview
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start the app, first run:
`npm install`

Then run
`npm run start`

### Notes

The chosen alert is `window.alert`.  This is intentionally chosen for its invasiveness, because it intuitively seems that a strict pomodoro timer should be invasive to your current tasks, in order to truly ensure of awareness that the interval is expired.
